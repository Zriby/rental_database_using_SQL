# Investigate a Relational Database using MySQL
A Udacity project I have made to help improve and tone my SQL skills and build its visualizations. This project was created on March 2021.

I also provided a snapshot of the feedback I received from the instructor marking 
my work in 'feedback.png'.

## Project Overview
In this project, I will use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of my project submission, I will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of my queries.

## Program Execution
Open 'Visualization.pdf' to view the 4 different Visualization questions. You can view the SQL queries in 'Query.sql'
:exclamation:**NOTE: The database file is in zipformat ( dvdrental.zip) so you need to extract it to  dvdrental.tar before loading the sample database into the database server.**


## Entity Relationship Diagram
Open 'ER diagram.pdf' to display the relationship of entity sets stored in the database.

## Statistics Computed
The code will provide the following information:

1. We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. 
The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.
Create a query that lists the amount of movies rented for each film category it is classified in.

2. Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. 
Find the rental duration of each movie category and its movie count.


3. Provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category.
The resulting table should have three columns: Category, Rental length category,Count


4. Show the top 10 paying customers and the highest differences across their monthly payment in 2017. 
The difference of payment will be in absoloute value! so negative sign differences are included as well.
So if a customer has a difference of 50 and -60, the highest difference is 60.
Order by name .
